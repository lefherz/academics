## definitions of democracy

Some say, the problem of democracy is, that in large & complex societies direct democracy is not possible

modern democracy after Claude Lefort: "MD is a society in which power, law and knowledge experience a radical indeterminacy"
- mit Zerschlagung des Absolutismus entscheidet nicht mehr eine Autorität über Objektivität, sondern viele Subjektivitäten
- democracy is an empty place, but one of power

Mouffes notion of democracy. 2 aspects:
- democracy as a form of rule, that means popular souvereignty
- democracy as symbolic framework through which rule is exercised

## democratic vs liberal school of thought

democratic:
- "power should be exercised by the people", popular souvereignty
- will of the people should be expressed without hindrances
- Logic of "us" and "them" always shows up
- The collective identity resulting from the group process of articulation ist immer mehr als die Summe ihrer Einzelteile

liberal:
- separation between church and state
- rule of law
- individual rights
- distinction between public & private

# democratic paradox

Democratic and liberal thought only reconciled after long struggles - their different logics have different dynamics

Liberals want to defend the individual against the group, democrats want the group to exercise their will

Kein Platz für "Freiheit des Einzelnen & Freiheit der Gruppe bedingen sich gegenseitig"

Demokratisches Paradox muss anerkannt werden, um unter seinen Bedingungen Politik zu machen

## Neue Mitte / Radical Centre

Spannung zwischen Demokratie & Liberalismus wird von Kontingenten Hegemonien stabilisiert.
Das führt dazu, dass alternativen verschwinden, und damit die Möglichkeit einer legitimen kritik an den herrschenden Machtverhältnissen.

Schröders "Neue Mitte" versucht Demokratie zu einem rationalen Konsensus zu perfektionieren, bei dem Widersprüche wie links und rechts aufgelöst werden

Kapitulation vor der neoliberalen Hegemonie. Einen rationalen Konsens "jenseits von links & rechts" zu propagieren, ist Hegemonie & Stillstand.

Vielleicht endet die Hegelsche Synthese doch in der preußischen konstitutionellen Monarchie?

## Neues Toolset: Agonistischer Pluralismus

Habermas & Rawls fassen mit ihrer deliberativen Demokratie die Dynamiken moderner Demokratie nicht ausreichend
* Beide wollen Kompabilität von Freiheit & Partizipation gefunden haben
* Beide Lösungen sind unzureichend, weil Rawls mehr wert auf Liberalismus, Habermas auf Demokratie legt

Rediscription of liberal democracy as "antagonistic pluralism"
* democratic paradox, not contradiction: use the tension in a positive way, not destructive contradiction
* Constantly challenging inclusion/exclusion is good for human rights
* The paradox makes both perfect liberty and perfect equality impossible
* But opens a space where they can coexist, only possibility in which rights can both exist *and* be exercised
* Rationalists try to eradicate that tension & with it this possibility for the illusion that rational consensus can be achieved
* But pluralist democratic politics consists in pragmatic, precarious & necessary unstable forms of negotiating that paradox

Philosophers she grounds upon
* Wittgenstein
  * Agreement is reached through participation in common forms of life - "Einstimmung", not "Einverstand"
* Derrida
  * Constitutive Outside - important to understand us/them dynamics in all collective identities
  * Outside is incommensurable with the Inside, but also condition of emergence of the Inside
  * Outside is not outside of the concrete Inside, but challenges concreteness itself
  * Not: "there is no us without them", but "there couldn't be any us without them", because us & them are not opposites

Antagonism
* When us/them becomes friend/enemy, it becomes an antagonism, becomes political
* If collective identities need us/them, there will always be possibilities of antagonisms
* democratic politics need to create conditions which make antagonisms less likely

Agonism
* Antagonism proper: Enemies, who have no common symbolic space
* Agonism: Adversaries, who share common symbolic space, but are enemies because they want to organize this space differently

Politics without an adversary
* Deliberative Democracy
  * Well-ordered society problematic for a pluralist approach
  * Rawls tries to erase the adversary, expelling legitimate opposition
* Radical Centre
  * All interests can be reconciled, everybody can be part of "the people", if they identify with "the project"
  * Justifies neo-liberal hegemony by evacuating the dimension of antagonism and postulating "general interest" of the people
  * cycle of confrontional politics has come to an end, left/right-distinction unnecessary, since social bipolarity ceased to exist
  * New individualism needss a "life politics of dialog" to reach the various areas of personal life
  * misses the power relations of post-industrial societies - capitalism isn't more harmless after its transformation
  * Even without a radical alternative to capitalism, social democracy must challenge entrenched wealth and power
  * Maintains existing hierarchies

Modern liberal democracy
* Creates a space where confrontation is kept open, power relations are put into question no victory is final.
* Condition of possibility of a pluralist democracy is at the same time condition of impossibility of its perfect implementation
* That's why acknowledging the paradox is important

## Empirical political theory

new understanding of democracy is needed
* not popular democracy, but rather aggregation of preferences
* political parties for which ppl can vote in regular intervals
* Democracy: system in which people can accept or reject their leaders in competition

Descriptive, not normative theory
* common good and general will have to be relinquished
* the people = pluralism of interests and values
* ppl act on self-interest rather than interest of community
* popular participation in decisions is to be discouraged and destabilizes the system
* Stability & order: Compromise among interests > mobilizing ppl to illusory consensus of common good
* leads to an instrumentalist perspective on democracy

Critic from deliberatives
* Origin of current disaffection with democratic institutions and crisis of legitimacy of western democracies
* Moral dimension needs to be recovered
* possible societal consensus not only about procedures of democracy, but over morals

## Deliberative Democracy

Not anti-liberals despite being marxists
* critical of certain liberal modus vivendi
* stress importance of liberal values in modern democracy
* not relinquish liberalism but recover its moral dimension

Normative Rationality
* Allegiance to liberal democracy through reconciling democratic souvereignty with liberal institutions
* Deliberation makes it possible to reach consensus which satisfies rationality *and* democratic legitimacy
* reformulating democracy in a way which eliminates danger to liberal values
* popular souvereignty is intersubjectivity: "communicatively generated power"
* By criticizing instrumental rationality & self-interest, DDs insist on the rationality at work in communicative action and free public reason

Objectives
* make co-originality of individual rights and popular souvereignty visible ("Freiheit des Einzelnen & Freiheit der Gruppe bedingen sich gegenseitig")
* grounding authority and legitimacy on public reasoning
* rationality which is not merely instrumental, but has a normative dimension
  * Rawls: reasonable standarts which ppl would agree on in the original position
  * Habermas: communicative rationality, consensus reached in the ideal speech situation
* The legitimacy of the democratic process depends on how fair and rational the process is
* The more equal, impartial and open the process is, the more likely truly generalizable interests will be accepted by the affected

Flight from Pluralism
* Habermas' weakness: his solution must include a substantive dimension, as results of the procedure can't be excluded from their design
* Rawls' weakness: too strong separation between public & private. Things he deems private are sometimes subject to debate
* Both fail to define a domain not subject to pluralism of values, where a consensus without exclusion could be reached
* The realm of politics is not a neutral terrain without pluralism, where rational & universal solutions could be formulated

Problem of Allegiance
* Habermas trusts on communicative rationality and the democratic process to sustain allegiance
* Not a matter of rational justification, but of availability of democratic forms of individuality & subjectivity
* citizen/subject in current democratic theory is framed as prior to society, bearer of natural rights and
  * either utility maximizing agents
  * or rational subjects.
  * Abstracted from social power relations & culture; exclude the conditions of existence of such a subject

Democratic Citizenship in pluralistic agonism
* Accepting that there can't be a social relation without power
* democratic individuals can only be made by multiplying institutions, discourses & forms of life with democratic values
* democratic citizenship has to be a practice, not an argumentation
* Rules can't be created on abstract principles and applied to cases, they are inseparable from specific forms of life
* Separations beween procedural & substantial, moral & ethical can't be maintained - There is no neutrality

## Agonistisches Modell der Demokratie

Soziale Objektivität
* Hegemony & Socialist Strategy: Jede Soziale Objektivität ist politisch und wird durch social power konstituiert
* jede Soziale Objektivität zeigt die Spuren des Ausschlusses, der sie konstituiert
* Dieser "mutual collapse" von Objektivität und Macht ist "Hegemonie"
* Politische Praxis repräsentiert nicht bestehende Identitäten, sondern konstituiert sie ständig neu, prekär & verwundbar

Macht & Demokratie
* Deliberative Demokratie: je mehr Demokratie, desto weniger Macht konstituiert soziale Beziehungen
* Wenn man akzeptiert, dass Macht soziale Beziehungen konstituiert, geht es nur noch darum, welche Macht Demokratie konstituiert
* Dann ist die ideale Demokratie nicht mehr harmonisch
* The democratic Character of a society can only be given by the fact that no limited social actor can attribute to herself the representation of the totality and claim to have the 'mastery' of the foundation

Legitimität
* Es ist zwar nicht alle Macht legitim, aber
  * Wenn Macht sich durchsetzen konnte, dann weil sie in Teilen als legitim anerkannt wurde
  * wenn Legitimität nicht auf a prioris basiert, dann weil sie irgendwo auf erfolgreicher Macht basiert
* Diese Legitimität geht verloren, wenn man wie DD die Möglichkeit Machtfreier rationaler Argumentation formuliert, wo Legitimität in purer Rationalität gründet

Alternative Model
* The Political: Antagonism inherent in human relations
* Politics: Ensemble of practices, discourses & institutions to organize human coexistence
* politics domesticate the political
* Consensus without exclusion erradicates the political
* Central question of democratic politics: posit us/them in a way that is compatible with pluralist politics
* Liberal democratic tolerance: we combat ideas of adversaries, but we do not question their right to defend their ideas
* This agonism can't be resolved through rational discussion
* Aim of democratic politics: transform antagonism into agonism

Conflict and Democracy
* Conflict doesnt't jeopardize democracy, it's its condition of existence
* democracies refuse to suppress conflict with authoritarian order, but recognize and legitimate it
* common ground which makes adversaries an "us", is a space of conflictial consensus
* If no democratic political positions clash, there will be clashes between other forms of collective identification
* That's why a consensus in the public sphere is a bad idea - every consensus is result of provisional hegemony

By warning us against the illusion that a fully achieved democracy could ever be instantiated, it forces us to keep the democratic contestation alive.
Coming to terms with the hegemonic nature of social relations and identities, it can contribute to subverting the everprasent temptation existing in
democratic societies to naturalize its frontiers and essentialize its identities.
