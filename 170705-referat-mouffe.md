## definitions of democracy

Some say, the problem of democracy is, that in large & complex societies direct democracy is not possible

modern democracy after Claude Lefort: "MD is a society in which power, law and knowledge experience a radical indeterminacy"
- mit Zerschlagung des Absolutismus entscheidet nicht mehr eine Autorität über Objektivität, sondern viele Subjektivitäten
- democracy is an empty place, but one of power

Mouffes notion of democracy. 2 aspects:
- democracy as a form of rule, that means popular souvereignty
- democracy as symbolic framework through which rule is exercised

## democratic vs liberal school of thought

democratic:
- "power should be exercised by the people", popular souvereignty
- will of the people should be expressed without hindrances
- Logic of "us" and "them" always shows up
- The collective identity resulting from the group process of articulation ist immer mehr als die Summe ihrer Einzelteile

liberal:
- separation between church and state
- rule of law
- individual rights
- distinction between public & private

# democratic paradox

Democratic and liberal thought only reconciled after long struggles - their different logics have different dynamics

Liberals want to defend the individual against the group, democrats want the group to exercise their will

Kein Platz für "Freiheit des Einzelnen & Freiheit der Gruppe bedingen sich gegenseitig"

Demokratisches Paradox muss anerkannt werden, um unter seinen Bedingungen Politik zu machen

## Neue Mitte / Radical Centre

Spannung zwischen Demokratie & Liberalismus wird von Kontingenten Hegemonien stabilisiert.
Das führt dazu, dass alternativen verschwinden, und damit die Möglichkeit einer legitimen kritik an den herrschenden Machtverhältnissen.

Schröders "Neue Mitte" versucht Demokratie zu einem rationalen Konsensus zu perfektionieren, bei dem Widersprüche wie links und rechts aufgelöst werden

Kapitulation vor der neoliberalen Hegemonie. Einen rationalen Konsens "jenseits von links & rechts" zu propagieren, ist Hegemonie & Stillstand.

Vielleicht endet die Hegelsche Synthese doch in der preußischen konstitutionellen Monarchie?

## Neues Toolset: Agonistischer Pluralismus

Habermas & Rawls fassen mit ihrer deliberativen Demokratie die Dynamiken moderner Demokratie nicht ausreichend
* Beide wollen Kompabilität von Freiheit & Partizipation gefunden haben
* Beide Lösungen sind unzureichend, weil Rawls mehr wert auf Liberalismus, Habermas auf Demokratie legt

Rediscription of liberal democracy as "antagonistic pluralism"
* democratic paradox, not contradiction: use the tension in a positive way, not destructive contradiction
* Constantly challenging inclusion/exclusion is good for human rights
* The paradox makes both perfect liberty and perfect equality impossible
* But opens a space where they can coexist, only possibility in which rights can both exist *and* be exercised
* Rationalists try to eradicate that tension & with it this possibility for the illusion that rational consensus can be achieved
* But pluralist democratic politics consists in pragmatic, precarious & necessary unstable forms of negotiating that paradox

Philosophers she grounds upon
* Wittgenstein
  * Agreement is reached through participation in common forms of life - "Einstimmung", not "Einverstand"
* Derrida
  * Constitutive Outside - important to understand us/them dynamics in all collective identities
  * Outside is incommensurable with the Inside, but also condition of emergence of the Inside
  * Outside is not outside of the concrete Inside, but challenges concreteness itself
  * Not: "there is no us without them", but "there couldn't be any us without them", because us & them are not opposites

Antagonism
* When us/them becomes friend/enemy, it becomes an antagonism, becomes political
* If collective identities need us/them, there will always be possibilities of antagonisms
* democratic politics need to create conditions which make antagonisms less likely

Agonism
* Antagonism proper: Enemies, who have no common symbolic space
* Agonism: Adversaries, who share common symbolic space, but are enemies because they want to organize this space differently

Politics without an adversary
* Deliberative Democracy
  * Well-ordered society problematic for a pluralist approach
  * Rawls tries to erase the adversary, expelling legitimate opposition
* Radical Centre
  * All interests can be reconciled, everybody can be part of "the people", if they identify with "the project"
  * Justifies neo-liberal hegemony by evacuating the dimension of antagonism and postulating "general interest" of the people
  * cycle of confrontional politics has come to an end, left/right-distinction unnecessary, since social bipolarity ceased to exist
  * New individualism needss a "life politics of dialog" to reach the various areas of personal life
  * misses the power relations of post-industrial societies - capitalism isn't more harmless after its transformation
  * Even without a radical alternative to capitalism, social democracy must challenge entrenched wealth and power
  * Maintains existing hierarchies

Modern liberal democracy
* Creates a space where confrontation is kept open, power relations are put into question no victory is final.
* Condition of possibility of a pluralist democracy is at the same time condition of impossibility of its perfect implementation
* That's why acknowledging the paradox is important

## Empirical political theory

new understanding of democracy is needed
* not popular democracy, but rather aggregation of preferences
* political parties for which ppl can vote in regular intervals
* Democracy: system in which people can accept or reject their leaders in competition

Descriptive, not normative theory
* common good and general will have to be relinquished
* the people = pluralism of interests and values
* ppl act on self-interest rather than interest of community
* popular participation in decisions is to be discouraged and destabilizes the system
* Stability & order: Compromise among interests > mobilizing ppl to illusory consensus of common good
* leads to an instrumentalist perspective on democracy

Critic from deliberatives
* Origin of current disaffection with democratic institutions and crisis of legitimacy of western democracies
* Moral dimension needs to be recovered
* possible societal consensus not only about procedures of democracy, but over morals

## Deliberative Democracy

Not anti-liberals despite being marxists
* critical of certain liberal modus vivendi
* stress importance of liberal values in modern democracy
* not relinquish liberalism but recover its moral dimension

Normative Rationality
* Allegiance to liberal democracy through reconciling democratic souvereignty with liberal institutions
* Deliberation makes it possible to reach consensus which satisfies rationality *and* democratic legitimacy
* reformulating democracy in a way which eliminates danger to liberal values
* popular souvereignty is intersubjectivity: "communicatively generated power"

Objectives
* make co-originality of individual rights and popular souvereignty visible ("Freiheit des Einzelnen & Freiheit der Gruppe bedingen sich gegenseitig")
* grounding authority and legitimacy on public reasoning
* rationality which is not merely instrumental, but has a normative dimension
  * Rawls: reasonable standarts which ppl would agree on in the original position
  * Habermas: communicative rationality, consensus reached in the ideal speech situation
* The legitimacy of the democratic process depends on how fair and rational the process is
* The more equal, impartial and open the process is, the more likely truly generalizable interests will be accepted by the affected

Flight from Pluralism
* Habermas' weakness: his solution must include a substantive dimension, as results of the procedure can't be excluded from their design
* Rawls' weakness: too strong separation between public & private. Things he deems private are sometimes subject to debate
* Both fail to define a domain not subject to pluralism of values, where a consensus without exclusion could be reached
* The realm of politics is not a neutral terrain without pluralism, where rational & universal solutions could be formulated
